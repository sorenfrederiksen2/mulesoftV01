==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Connection a| <<Config_Basic, Basic Connection Provider>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Response Timeout a| Number |  The timeout for request to the remote service. |  60 | {nbsp}
| Response Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  A time unit which qualifies the Response Timeout} |  SECONDS | {nbsp}
| Streaming Type a| String |  Defines if the request should be sent using streaming. Setting the value to AUTO will automatically define the best strategy based on the request content. |  AUTO | {nbsp}
| Name a| String |  The identifier of this element used to reference it in other components |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration.

==== Connection Types
[[Config_Basic]]
===== Basic Connection Provider


This is the last layer of the connection provider generation gap pattern. It is what finally gets exposed as the connection provider, including all customizations made in the refinement layer.
